# algorithms-cpp
Algorithms for competitive programming in C++.

Algorithms are presented as single header file templates that can be `#include`d or copy and pasted into a solution.

## Algorithms
- **Fenwick Tree** (a.k.a Binary Indexed Tree) – `FenwickTree.h`, `FenwickTree2D.h` (2D)
- **Segment Tree** – `SegmentTree.h`, `SegmentTree2D.h` (2D as segment tree of segment trees), `SegmentQuadtree.h` (2D as quadtree)
- **Union-Find Disjoint Sets** – `UFDS.h`
